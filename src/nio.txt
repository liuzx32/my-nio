For normal use cases, the application in the above picture means Kylin Web,
which contains a web interface for cube building, querying and all sorts of management.
Kylin Web launches a query engine for querying and a cube build engine for building cubes.
These two engines interact with the Hadoop components, like hive and hbase.
Except for some prerequisite software installations,
the core of Kylin installation is accomplished by running a single script.
After running the script, you will be able to build sample cube and query the tables behind the cubes via a unified web interface.
